This repository contains the implementation of core data structure and algorithm concepts using Python. The project demonstrates Stack ADT, recursion, and algorithmic logic. Implemented Components Part1: Stack ADT A Stack Abstract Data Type with the following operations: push(x), pop(), peek(), is_empty() The program provides a menu-driven interface for user interaction. Part2: Factorial & Fibonacci (Recursion) Factorial: Recursive implementation, valid for n ≥ 0, handles invalid input. Fibonacci: Recursive implementation, prints the first 20 Fibonacci numbers. Part3: Recursive Binary Search Uses recursion to search an element in a sorted array. Returns the index if found, otherwise prints "Element not found".
